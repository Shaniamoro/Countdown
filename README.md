## A Different Countdown Conundrum 

The Countdown is a British game show which consists of word and number puzzles. In the numbers part of the game, players attempt to reach a target number by performing basic arithmetic operations on a set of six “large” and “small” numbers. The target numbers range from 100 to 999; the “large numbers” are chosen from 25, 50, 75, and 100; the “small numbers” from 1-10. Since the numbers are chosen at random, not every configuration of numbers is solvable. This talk explores how the game changes when exponentiation is allowed in addition to the basic arithmetic operations. The pool of numbers was also reduced to only include the small numbers. We attempted to find the smallest set of numbers which can generate every target number with these modifications.
